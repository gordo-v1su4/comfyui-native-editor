      "prompt": "Low-angle, iPhone-style shaky handheld shot.  Rain streaks across the lens, obscuring the view.  A young detective, trench coat slick with rain, exits a taxi at a futuristic airport at night.  The airport terminal is sleek glass and steel, illuminated by a color palette of 50% grey, 30% blue, and 20% neon.  A low-hanging neon sign partially obscures the detective's face, adding to the noir atmosphere.  The detective's expression is unseen, shrouded in shadow and rain.  The camera pans up slowly, revealing the immense scale of the airport, its towering architecture dwarfed only by the stormy sky.  Water droplets cling to the lens, creating a distorted, cinematic effect.  Focus remains on the detective as he moves, highlighting his isolation in the vast, rain-lashed space.  The overall mood is dark, atmospheric, and suspenseful.",

      "prompt": "Handheld iPhone-style shot, mimicking shaky cam, following a young, weary detective through a crowded, futuristic airport terminal at night.  Fluorescent lights flicker intermittently, casting harsh blue and grey shadows across the polished metal and glass surfaces.  The color palette is predominantly grey (50%), cool blue (30%), punctuated by neon accents (20%).  The detective, his face partially obscured by shadow, nervously glances over his shoulder, his reflection briefly caught in a metallic surface.  A mysterious woman, partially visible in the background, blends into the crowd.  Low-angle shots emphasize the claustrophobia of the terminal.  Rain streaks the large panoramic windows, blurring the outside world.  The camera remains close to the detective, conveying his disorientation and paranoia.  Sound design should incorporate the low hum of the terminal, the rhythmic drip of rain, and the muffled chatter of the crowd.",

      "prompt": "Generate a short video clip in the style of a noir film shot on an iPhone.  The scene is a close-up, night shot through a rain-streaked airport lounge window.  Fifty percent grey, thirty percent blue, and twenty percent neon lighting dominate.  Focus on a MYSTERIOUS WOMAN (30s), elegantly dressed in a dark, flowing coat and wide-brimmed hat, her face mostly obscured.  The camera begins with a close-up on her delicately held, futuristic cigarette lighter.  Slowly pan up, revealing only a sliver of her face, her eyes reflecting the neon airport lights.  The Detective (young, unseen except for his reflection subtly in the window) is implied to be watching her from inside the lounge.  The overall mood is suspenseful and mysterious, enhanced by the grainy iPhone aesthetic.  Use shallow depth of field to emphasize the woman and the lighter.  The rain streaks create a visual barrier, adding to the sense of separation and intrigue.",
