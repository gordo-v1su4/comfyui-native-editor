A young girl (12 years old), with a sleek, metallic right arm that subtly glows, stands at the marketplace entrance, observing the chaos.  Low-angle shot, emphasizing the towering neon signs and the girl's small stature.  The camera slowly pushes in on her face, revealing a determined yet fearful expression.  Color palette: deep blues, purples, and electric pinks.",
      "prompt": "**Main Subject:** A young girl, approximately 12 years old, with shoulder-length dark hair. Her left arm is human, while her right arm is a sleek, metallic prosthetic that subtly pulses with a faint, internal blue-purple plasma glow.  The metallic arm has visible, intricate circuitry etched into its surface.\n\n**Clothing / Appearance:** She wears a dark, rain-slicked, utilitarian jacket with a high collar, dark pants, and worn but sturdy boots. The overall aesthetic is practical and slightly dystopian.\n\n**Pose / Action:** The girl stands at the entrance of a bustling marketplace, slightly hunched against the driving rain. She observes the chaotic scene with a mixture of fascination and apprehension, her gaze fixed on the swirling crowds and neon lights.  Her metallic arm hangs loosely at her side, the faint plasma glow barely visible in the rain-streaked light.\n\n**Expression / Emotion:** Her face is partially obscured by the shadows of her hood and the falling rain, but her eyes convey a mixture of determination, apprehension, and a hint of underlying fear.  Her mouth is slightly pursed, suggesting a tense concentration.\n\n**Camera Direction & Framing:** Low-angle, Dutch tilt shot. The camera starts at a distance, emphasizing the towering neon signs and the girl's small stature against the overwhelming scale of the marketplace. The camera slowly pushes in towards her face, using a shallow depth of field to blur the background and focus on her expression.  The final shot frames her face tightly, showing the detail in her eyes and the subtle glow of her prosthetic arm.\n\n**Environment / Background:** A crowded, rain-lashed futuristic marketplace at midnight.  Towering holographic advertisements in vibrant, distorted neon colors (deep blues, purples, and electric pinks) blaze overhead, casting flickering light and reflections on the wet, reflective surfaces of the marketplace stalls and the surrounding buildings.  The rain creates a constant, shimmering curtain of water.  The overall atmosphere is chaotic and slightly menacing.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**  Predominantly dark and moody, with sporadic bursts of vibrant neon light from the holographic advertisements.  The rain acts as a natural diffusion filter, softening the harsh neon glow. The overall atmosphere is noir-ish, utilizing chiaroscuro lighting to accentuate the girl's expression and the metallic sheen of her prosthetic arm. Rain streaks across the lens, adding to the gritty, atmospheric feel.\n\n**Style En",

Low angle shots emphasizing her speed and vulnerability.  Quick cuts to over-the-shoulder shots revealing glimpses of pursuing figures.  Dynamic framing, utilizing Dutch angles to enhance the noir feel.\n\n**Environment / Background:** Narrow, rain-slicked alleyway in a futuristic dystopian marketplace.  Overhanging neon signs cast electric blue and indigo reflections on the wet pavement.  Garbage bins, overflowing dumpsters, and graffiti-covered walls create a claustrophobic atmosphere.\n\n**Lighting & Atmosphere:**  Predominantly dark, with vibrant neon signs creating pools of electric blue and indigo light.  Rain reflects the neon light, creating a shimmering, oily effect on the ground.  The overall atmosphere is dark, suspenseful, and intensely atmospheric.\n\n**Style Enhancers:**  35mm film grain, chromatic aberration in the neon reflections, subtle motion blur to emphasize speed, volumetric lighting to enhance the rain and neon reflections, deep shadows to obscure the pursuers' faces.",
